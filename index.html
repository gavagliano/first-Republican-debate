<p class="custom-paragraph"><span class="first-line">"How will you as both president of the United States and leader of the Republican Party calm their fears that the Republican Party doesn't care about climate change?"</span></p>

   
<p class="custom-paragraph">This question, which was submitted by Catholic University student Alexander Diaz on behalf of fellow young conservatives, was the only audience question posed to the eight candidates in the first Republican presidential debate on August 23, 2023 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
As the only question posed to the Republican candidates, this moment not only marked a shift in the priorities and social conscience of young conservatives, but the United States’ shift into a new political era.
<p class="custom-paragraph">"The climate change agenda is a hoax," firmly replied former tech and finance executive Vivek Ramaswamy.
</p>

<p class="custom-paragraph">The 2024 presidential election will certainly be a historic election. It is the first post-Covid election and one that sees a former president (who is also a candidate) embroiled in heavy legal troubles. While voters of both parties can agree the economy is the top concern for this country, social problems often represent the widest partisan gaps. Covid-19 revealed structural inequalities in areas including education, healthcare, and housing, pushing historical partisan issues to the forefront of the 2024 election. During the first Republican debate, moderators Brett Bair and Martha MacCallum touched upon events since Biden’s election in 2020 - the overturning of Roe v. Wade, climate disasters in California and Florida, and seven million migrants crossing the border. Are these partisan issues uniting or further dividing voters?
</p>

<p class="custom-paragraph">Comparing research studies from Pew Research Center in the years before and after Covid, here are how Democrat and Republican voters differ on the partisan issues of climate change, abortion, and immigration:

</div>
<p class="custom-paragraph">Abortion, climate change, and immigration remain the biggest gaps in voter concerns, with climate change representing the largest differences in both 2019 and 2023. In the 2023 study, almost 60 percent of Democrat voters said that dealing with climate change should be a top priority for the president versus just 13% of Republicans.
</p>

<p class="custom-paragraph">After the overturning of Roe v. Wade, the percentage of Democrat voters who said abortion is “very important” to their vote increased to 71% in 2022 from 35% in 2020. Abortion continues to scramble elections — even in GOP strongholds like Kansas, Kentucky and Ohio — as voters reject Republican efforts to restrict access to the procedure. 
</p>

<p class="custom-paragraph">While it seems like both parties are becoming more divided on social issues, former UN ambassador and Republican contender Nikki Haley called for finding a consensus and suggested that policies like a late-term abortion ban have broad appeal.
</p>

<p class="custom-paragraph"> “Let’s treat this like a respectful issue that it is and humanize the situation and stop demonizing the situation,” she said during the first GOP debate.
